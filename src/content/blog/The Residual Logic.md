<p class="en">The first half of my life was a descent into a self-imposed exile. I was a mole, mistaking the frantic scratching of technical labor for the cultivation of a soul. In that small, dimly lit room, I wove a tapestry of logic that I believed was my own, only to find that I was merely a weaver in another man’s workshop. The 'I' that I thought I was building was, in fact, a shadow cast by the utility I provided to others.</p>
<p class="zh">前半生是一场自投罗网的流放。我如同一只鼹鼠，误将技术劳作中那份狂躁的抓挠，当作是对灵魂的耕耘。在那个昏暗的方寸之地，我编织着自以为属于我的逻辑织锦，最终却发现，我不过是他人作坊里的一名织工。那个我以为正在建立的“自我”，本质上只是由我为他人提供的“效用”所投射出的虚影。</p>

<p class="en">The disillusionment arrived not as a thunderclap, but as a slow, cold erosion. On this soil, the architecture of worth is not built on the elegance of a solution, but on the ruthless leverage of capital and the silent geometry of networks. I held the precision, yet I owned no ground. To realize that your greatest strengths are but instruments for your own marginalization is a quiet, sharp pain. Everything was for them; nothing was for the life that breathed within me.</p>
<p class="zh">幻灭并非如雷霆般降临，而是一场缓慢、冰冷的侵蚀。在这片土壤上，价值的架构并非建立在方案的优雅之上，而建立在资本残酷的杠杆与人脉沉默的几何学中。我掌握着精确，却不拥有寸土。意识到你最引以为傲的力量，竟然只是加速你边缘化的工具，这是一种寂静而尖锐的痛楚。一切皆为他人，唯独没有半分留给那个在我体内呼吸的生命。</p>

<p class="en">There is no grand reconstruction, only the clarity of a ruin. Standing amidst the debris of what I thought was 'value,' I find no desire for a new empire. The silence of Batangas taught me that sovereignty is not found in the scale of one's construction, but in the refusal to be consumed. My technical craft remains, but it has lost its status as a temple. It is now merely a cold blade, kept sharp for the sole purpose of carving out a space for my own breathing.</p>
<p class="zh">并没有什么宏大的重构，只有废墟带来的清透。立于那份曾被我视作“价值”的碎屑之中，我已无意建立新的帝国。巴丹加斯的寂静教会了我：主权并不在于构筑规模的大小，而在于拒绝被吞噬。技艺尚在，但它已不再是神殿，而仅仅是一把冰冷的短刃。保持锐利，唯是为了在重重围困中，为自己的呼吸凿出一点空间。</p>

<p class="en">The silence persists, and the soil remains indifferent. I am still here, perhaps still a mole in some sense, but I no longer mistake the tunnel for the world. If the bridge exists, it is not a path to a glorious destination, but a narrow, precarious plank spanning the void between the utility I perform and the self I preserve. I inhabit the ruins of my own making, watchful and uncompromised. The masonry is complete, not because the wall is high, but because it is finally mine.</p>
<p class="zh">寂静依旧，土壤依旧冷漠。我依然身处此地，某种意义上或许仍是一只鼹鼠，但我不再将隧道误认为整个世界。如果那座“桥”真的存在，它也不是通往辉煌终点的坦途，而是一块窄而惊险的木板，跨越在“我所提供的效用”与“我所保留的自我”之间的虚无之上。我栖居在自己亲手造成的废墟里，警觉，且不再妥协。构筑已成，并非因为墙高千尺，而是因为这堵墙，终于是我自己的。</p>
